# File Filter Program

This program filters files based on their extensions (txt, pdf, png, jpg, jpeg).

- **desktop_path**: The general path where I choose to keep my files. You can select your own path.
- **target_dir_name**: The name of the directory where the filtered files will be saved.
- **source_folder**: The path of the directory where all the files are initially placed.
